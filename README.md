# AI-Bias

This project is intended to analyze the origins and effects of bias in Artifical Intelligence.
With the growing influence of AI on our lives, it is important to understand how this increasingly powerful technology is
affected by human biases, and how it can in turn serve to reinforce in humans some of the same biases that were spawned from
human influence. We plan to closely consider the concept of of bias: What is a bias? Is it inherently negative? What positive and negative 
effects can occur from attempts to remove bias from AI? It is increasingly essential to consider these questions, in order to understand
the consequences for society, and to become aware of how the technology is shaping individual perceptions and decisions.
